# WordPress Emojis

Since, at least, WordPress 5.1.4 there's a bug where the emoji support detection code doesn't fully work in all scenarios.

In my Android 10 (Google Pixel) using Firefox the emojis where not being converted to the [Twemoj](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji). It's shame.

This plugin remove the core emoji settings adding a new one which will run in any environment.
